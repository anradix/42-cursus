# get_next_line
_Subject [here](../subjects/get_next_line.subject.pdf)_

### Introduction
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line
ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.
This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
static variables.

### How do I use it?

       git clone https://github.com/antoineradix/42-cursus.git

3. Build the executable
