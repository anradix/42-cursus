# What is 42?

42 is a private, non-profit and tuition-free engineering and programming school based on peer-to-peer learning and hands-on projects. It offers a flexible 3-5 years self-paced and tuition-free curriculum.

42's educational model is qualified as innovative and is unlike any other program: no teachers, courses or classes, no tuition, no fees and no grades required to enter the school. The only admission requirements are to be 18+ years old and then to complete the entrance examination: 'la Piscine'.

A Piscine (that means 'swimming pool' in French) is a 4-week intensive and immersive coding bootcamp, 7 days a week. No previous programming experience required. 900 applicants learn C programming and bash scripting through daily exercises. Selected candidates (appr. 250 for Paris and until 2018 since the process changed in 2019) can register to be full-time students at 42, a tuition-free engineering school.
