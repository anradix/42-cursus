### Introduction
    C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
    standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions,
    understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
    projects.
    Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
    with your own. Take the time to expand yourlibftthroughout the year.``
